# Arithmetic Calculator REST API

This is a Node.js based backend REST API for a simple arithmetic calculator functionality. The API supports the following basic arithmetic operations: 
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Square root
- Random string generation.

Each operation has a separate cost per request, and users have a starting credit/balance. Each request will be deducted from the user's balance, and if the user's balance is not enough to cover the request cost, the request will be denied.
